# Write Up CTF or Machines
My CTF resolutions on TryHackme, Hack The Box and Hacking Club platforms
<p> 
The Cherrytree application was used to take notes on the machines, I will update as I manage to own them, soon I will also propose solutions to 
correct the vulnerabilities found.
I'm app use <strong>CherryTree</strong> to write my notes from the CTF or Rooms completed, with they also possible export to PDF
